The user friendly Ethereum Wallet for your WordPress site.

== Description ==

The Ethereum Wallet WordPress plugin auto-creates a user wallet upon registration and allows user to send Ether or ERC20/ERC223 tokens from it.

> It is a valuable addition for the [Cryptocurrency Product for WooCommerce](https://ethereumico.io/product/cryptocurrency-product-for-woocommerce-standard-license/ "Cryptocurrency Product for WooCommerce") plugin.

Using these two plugins your non-techie customers can register to obtain an Ethereum account address and then buy your tokens to be sent to this new address.

* To show user's Ethereum account address insert the `[ethereum-wallet-account]` shortcode wherever you like. You can use `label="My label"` attribute to set your own label text. And `nolabel="yes"` attribute to display no label at all.
* To show user's Ethereum account address's Ether balance insert the `[ethereum-wallet-balance]` shortcode wherever you like
* To show user's Ethereum account address's TSX ERC20 token balance insert the `[ethereum-wallet-balance tokenname="TSX" tokenaddress="0x6Fe928d427b0E339DB6FF1c7a852dc31b651bD3a"]` shortcode wherever you like. [PRO version only!](https://ethereumico.io/product/wordpress-ethereum-wallet-plugin/ "The Ethereum Wallet WordPress plugin")
* To show the send Ether form insert the `[ethereum-wallet-sendform]` shortcode wherever you like. The ERC20 token send functionality is available in the [PRO version only!](https://ethereumico.io/product/wordpress-ethereum-wallet-plugin/ "The Ethereum Wallet WordPress plugin").
* To show an account's transactions history insert the `[ethereum-wallet-history direction="in"]` shortcode wherever you like. The direction attribute can have values `in` to show only input transactions, `out` to show only output transactions, or `inout` to show both input and output transactions. If attribute is omitted, the `inout` is used by default. The ERC20 tokens transactions are displayed in a [PRO version only!](https://ethereumico.io/product/wordpress-ethereum-wallet-plugin/ "The Ethereum Wallet WordPress plugin")
* Use the `user_ethereum_wallet_address` user_meta key to display the user's account address, or for the `Ethereum Wallet meta key` setting of the [Cryptocurrency Product for WooCommerce](https://ethereumico.io/product/cryptocurrency-product-for-woocommerce-standard-license/ "Cryptocurrency Product for WooCommerce") plugin
* The Ethereum Gas price is auto adjusted according to the [etherchain.org](https://www.etherchain.org) API
* This plugin is l10n ready
